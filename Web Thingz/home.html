    <h2>Hello!</h2>

    <p>I'm Hans, an educator and translator living in Jakarta, Indonesia. </p>
    <p>I have years of experience working with tutorship. I've created my own tutorship and also participate in teaching national to international students with various curriculums such as <a href="https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/">IB</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/why-choose-us/benefits-of-a-cambridge-education/international-curriculum/">Cambridge</a>. Subjects that I teach are mainly English and Mathematics, with levels ranging from elementary to high school materials.</p>

    <p>I've also worked as a translator. I have experience in translating both verbal and written form of Chinese, English, and Indonesian language.</p>

    <p>I am a student at <a href="https://www.esaunggul.ac.id/">Esa Unggul University</a>, majoring in the study of information technology. I am interested in the fields of artificial intelligence, data analysis, machine learning, and statistics. I am active with the use of SQL and Python.</p>

    <p>I run a small, work in progress website to learn Python, called <a href="/pyeceofcake/home.html">pyeceofcake</a>, a beginner-friendly project-based way to learn Python.</p>
